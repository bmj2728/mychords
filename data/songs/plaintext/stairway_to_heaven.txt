Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin
Key: Am

Am                 E+
There's a lady who's sure
     C                 D
All that glitters is gold
        F                     G               Am
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
                E+
When she gets there she knows
    C                 D
If the stores are all closed
        F                          G               Am
With a word she can get what she came for
C  D  F  Am
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
        C           D
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

        Am                E+
There's a sign on the wall
         C              D
But she wants to be sure
       F                       G                 Am
Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
              E+
In a tree by the brook
        C              D
There's a songbird who sings
    F                       G               Am
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
        G                F               G
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
        G                F               G
Ooh, it makes me wonder
